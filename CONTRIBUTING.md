## **How to Contribute**

Contributing to this project is easy and involves a few simple steps. Here's how to get started:

1. **Fork the repository**  
   Start by forking the project to your own GitHub account. This will create a personal copy of the repository where you can freely make changes.

   To fork the repository, click on the "Fork" button at the top-right of the GitHub repository page.

2. **Clone your fork**  
   Once you've forked the repository, clone your own version to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skmirajulislam/NLPulse-AI.git
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**  
   It’s best to work on your changes in a new branch. Create a new branch with a descriptive name related to the feature you're working on.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make your changes**  
   Now, you can make your changes in the local repository. If you’re adding a new feature, make sure to add tests as well.

5. **Commit your changes**  
   Once you're happy with your changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```

6. **Push your changes**  
   After committing your changes, push them to your forked repository on GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a pull request**  
   Go to your repository on GitHub and you will see a prompt to create a pull request. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button.

   Provide a description of the changes you made, why they’re important, and any other relevant information. Then click on the "Create pull request" button.

## **Reporting Issues**

If you find a bug or encounter an issue, please report it by creating a new issue in the repository. When creating an issue, try to provide as much detail as possible, including:
- A description of the issue or error
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Any relevant logs or screenshots

This will help us identify and resolve the problem more efficiently.

---

## **Feature Requests**

If you have a suggestion for a new feature or improvement, feel free to open a new issue with the label **Feature Request**. Please include:
- A clear description of the feature
- How it would benefit the application or users
- Any additional context or examples

We value suggestions that align with the project's goals and improve the overall user experience.

---

## **Code Style**

To ensure consistency across the project, please follow these coding guidelines:

- **Python Version**: Use Python 3.x (preferred version: Python 3.8+).
- **PEP 8**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style.
- **Docstrings**: Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and methods.
- **Flask Conventions**: Follow Flask’s best practices for routing, templates, and static files.

Before making a pull request, run your code through a linter to check for any syntax issues or style violations.

---

## **Testing**

We strongly recommend writing tests for any new features or bug fixes you implement. This ensures that the application works correctly and prevents future regressions.

To run the tests, follow these steps:
1. Install the testing dependencies (e.g., `pytest` or `unittest`).
2. Write tests in the `tests/` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).
3. Run the tests to verify your changes:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

If your changes pass the tests, feel free to submit your pull request.

---

## **Commit Messages**

Please follow these guidelines when writing commit messages:
- Use the present tense ("Fix bug" not "Fixed bug").
- Be clear and concise. For example:
  - `Add sentiment analysis prediction function`
  - `Fix issue with user login validation`
  - `Update README with setup instructions`
  
Commit messages should be descriptive enough to understand the changes made without needing to look at the code itself.

---

## **Pull Request Process**

We review every pull request to ensure it follows the project’s coding standards, passes tests, and aligns with the project’s goals.

1. **Open a pull request**: After pushing your changes, create a pull request to merge your feature branch into the `main` branch.
2. **Provide a detailed description**: In your pull request description, explain what changes you made and why.
3. **Request reviews**: Request reviews from project maintainers or collaborators.
4. **Address feedback**: Respond to any feedback or suggestions, making necessary changes.
5. **Merge the pull request**: Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch.
